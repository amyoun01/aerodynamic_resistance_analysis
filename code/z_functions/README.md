# README file for /z_functions sub-directory

This directory contains functions needed to run the analysis. Many of these functions were originally written in R for the bigleaf package by Knauer et al. (2018). We translated and verified these scripts from R to Matlab to help streamline our work flow. These functions that were translated are listed below.
